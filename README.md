## Data Modeling with Postgres
Hi! In this project, I have created a Postgres database with tables to analyze the data on songs and user activity on a new music streaming app from a company called Sparkify.

# Files
Below are the files used to complete this project.

**test.ipynb** - displays the first few rows of each table to let you check your database.

**create_tables.py** - drops and creates your tables. You run this file to reset your tables before each time you run your ETL scripts.

**etl.ipynb** - reads and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads the data into your tables. This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables. 

**etl. py** - reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into your tables. You can fill this out based on your work in the ETL notebook.

**sql_queries.py** - contains all your sql queries, and is imported into the last three files above.
